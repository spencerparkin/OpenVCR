# OpenVCR

This is a super simple wrapper around OpenCV, SDL and Adam Stark's AudioFile library that can record and/or show a live stream or playback a recording.

I'm not going to lie to you.  This is just stupid software, because I don't know a darn thing about streaming/mixing video/audio.  I'm just trying to learn stuff here.
